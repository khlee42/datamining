# Course objective

.blockquote[
*Analytics is the scientific process of transforming data into insights
for the purpose of making better decisions.*

<br>

This is an introductory data analytics course. Upon completion, you will be able to:

- process raw data,
- explore and visualize,
- run (simple) statistical analyses, and
- generate a reproducible document

All using R

---

# Course format

- Weekly modules will go live every Wednesday at 6:00 PM
- Lecture: to introduce essential concepts and skills
- Lab: for you to practice what you've learned in lecture (ungraded)
- Exercise: to improve your R fluency (graded)
- Homework: 2 individual assignments (graded)
- Exam: Midterm and final exams (graded)
- Please see [Syllabus](../../syllabus.html) for detail

---

## Toolkit

This course uses lots of hands-on exercises. You must have access to laptop/desktop and the software ready.

- R and R studio
- R markdown
- DataCamp
- Instructions will be provided when needed

---

## Exercise (50%)

- `DataCamp`: interactive R exercises
- You can take as many times as you want to complete an exercise until its due, and pass/fail will be given based on whether you have completed it.
- Each accounts for 5%
- 10 exercises in total.

---

## Homework (20%)

- HW1: Data wangling and visualization
- HW2: Data modeling
- Each accounts for 10%

---

## Exam (30%)

- Midterm (10%)
- Final (20%)
- The exams are non-cumulative: the topics covered in the midterm will not be questioned in the final exam. 

---

## Grading policy

```{r grading, echo=FALSE}
df <- tibble(
  Type=c("Exercise","Homework", "Midterm exam", "Final exam", "Total"),
  Percent=c("50%", "20%", "10%", "20%", "100%")
)
knitr::kable(df, escape = F) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", position = "left")
```

<br>

**Late submission: 5% deduction/day; won't be accepted after 10 days**  
**Deferring exam: Only for extraordinary situations; documentation required**

---

## Academic integrity

- Sharing/reusing code is essential part of any data science project. There is an enormous amount of code available on the web, and you can use any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow, RStudio Community).
- You are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice.  

<br>

**But**
- On individual assignments you **may not** directly send or make use of code from another student in this class or from the web,  
- On exams you must use the Lockdown browser and not communicate with your classmates.
- Please see [Policies](../../policies.html) for detail
