## Data
This exam uses the data about the infamous shipwreck story - titanic. It contains information about passengers on the ship and whether or not they survived the wreck. The data is pre-loaded, so you don't need to load any packages. Below is the description of the data.

```{r data_summary, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
glimpse(titanic)
```

## Question 1

What is the name of the passenger who bought the least expensive ticket?

1. Leonard, Mr. Lionel
2. ttalah, Mr. Sleiman
3. Coleff, Mr. Satio
4. Karlsson, Mr. Nils August

```{r q1, exercise=TRUE}
titanic %>% 
  select(Name, Fare) %>% 
  arrange(Fare)
```

```{r q1-hint}
titanic %>% 
  ...(..., ...) %>% 
  ...(...)
```

## Question 2

What is the name of the youngest passenger?

1. Appleton, Mrs. Edward Dale (Charlotte Lamson)
2. Hirvonen, Miss. Hildur E
3. Thomas, Master. Assad Alexander
4. Laroche, Miss. Simonne Marie Anne Andree

```{r q2, exercise=TRUE}
titanic %>% 
  select(Name, Age) %>% 
  arrange(Age)
```

```{r q2-hint}
titanic %>% 
  ...(..., Age) %>% 
  ...(...)
```

## Question 3

What is the average fare of the `Pclass` 1 tickets? Pick the closest one.

1. 87
2. 13
3. 21	
4. 11	

```{r q3, exercise=TRUE}
titanic %>% 
  group_by(Pclass) %>% 
  summarise(avgprice = mean(Fare))
```

```{r q3-hint}
titanic %>% 
  ...(Pclass) %>% 
  ...(avgprice = ...(Fare))
```

## Question 4

What is the average age of female passengers? Pick the closest one.

1. 20
2. 25
3. 28
4. 30

```{r q4, exercise=TRUE}
titanic %>% 
  group_by(Sex) %>% 
  summarise(avgage = mean(Age))
```

```{r q4-hint}
titanic %>% 
  ...(...) %>% 
  ...(avgage = ...(Age))
```

## Question 5

How many passengers from Pclass 2 were survived?

1. 80
2. 83
3. 85
4. 122

```{r q5, exercise=TRUE}
titanic %>% 
  filter(survived=="S") %>% 
  group_by(Pclass) %>% 
  summarise(n())
```

```{r q5-hint}
titanic %>% 
  ...(survived=="S") %>% 
  ...(...) %>% 
  ...(n())
```


## Question 6

Build a logistic regression model to predict the probability of survival using three variables - `Sex`, `Age`, and `Pclass.` 
Given the estimated model, what is the probability of a passenger who is male and 30 years old with Pclass 2 surviving the shipwreck? Pick the closest one.

1. 10%
2. 20%
3. 25%
4. 30%

```{r q6, exercise=TRUE}
mod <- glm(survived~Sex+Age+Pclass, titanic, family = "binomial")
predict(mod, data.frame(Sex = "male", Age = 30, Pclass = 2), type="response")
```

```{r q6-hint}
mod <- ...(..., titanic, family = "...")
...(mod, data.frame(Sex = "male", Age = 30, Pclass = 2), type="...")
```


## Question 7

Build a logistic regression model to predict the probability of survival using three variables - `Sex`, `Age`, and `Pclass`. 
Set the cutoff value at 50%; that is, passengers whose probability of survival is higher than 50% are considered survived.
How many false positives does the model produce? (i.e., the number of passengers who did not survive but labeled as survived) (Hint: create a confusion matrix)

1. 68
2. 83
3. 207
4. 356

```{r q7, exercise=TRUE}
mod <- glm(survived~Sex+Age+Pclass, titanic, family = "binomial")
p <- predict(mod, titanic, type="response")

survival <- ifelse(p > 0.5, "S", "NS")
p_class <- factor(survival)

confusionMatrix(p_class, titanic$survived)
```

```{r q7-hint}
mod <- ...(..., titanic, family = "...")
p <- ...(mod, titanic, type="...")

survival <- ...(p > 0.5, "S", "NS")
p_class <- ...(survival)

confusionMatrix(..., titanic$survived)
```


## Question 8

Build a logistic regression model to predict the probability of survival using three variables - `Sex`, `Age`, and `Pclass`. 
Set the cutoff value at 50%; that is, passengers whose probability of survival is higher than 50% are considered survived.
What's the accuracy of the model? Pick the closest one.

1. 70%
2. 80%
3. 90%
4. 60%

```{r q8, exercise=TRUE}
mod <- glm(survived~Sex+Age+Pclass, titanic, family = "binomial")
p <- predict(mod, titanic, type="response")

survival <- ifelse(p > 0.5, "S", "NS")
p_class <- factor(survival)

confusionMatrix(p_class, titanic$survived)
```

```{r q8-hint}
mod <- ...(..., titanic, family = "...")
p <- ...(mod, titanic, type="...")

survival <- ...(p > 0.5, "S", "NS")
p_class <- ...(survival)

confusionMatrix(..., titanic$survived)
```


## Question 9

Build a random forest model to predict the probability of survival using three variables - `Sex`, `Age`, and `Pclass.` Do the 3-fold cross validation. 
What's the highest accuracy? Pick the closest one.

1. 71%
2. 75%
3. 77%
4. 80%

```{r q9, exercise=TRUE}
set.seed(123) # Do not change this line

mod_forest <- train(
  survived ~ Sex + Age + Pclass,
  titanic,
  method = "ranger",
  trControl = trainControl(
    method = "cv",
    number = 3
  )
)
mod_forest
```

```{r q9-hint}
set.seed(123) # Do not change this line

mod_tree <- train(
  ...,
  titanic,
  method = "...",
  trControl = ...(
    method = "...",
    number = ...
  )
)
mod_tree
```
