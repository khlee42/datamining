Question 1, Score: 1
Student code:
flights %>%
  select(-year)
-->Great work!


Question 2, Score: 0
Student code:
flights1 <- flights %>%
  mutate(total_delay = dep_delay + arr_delay) %>% 
  arrange((total_delay))
-->Have a look at the fourth code chunk. The contents of the variable `flights1` aren't correct.


Question 3, Score: 1
Student code:
ggplot(flights1, aes(x=carrier, y=total_delay)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
-->Great work!


Question 4, Score: 1
Student code:
ggplot(flights1, aes(x=distance, y=total_delay)) + 
  geom_point()
-->Great work!


Question 5, Score: 1
Student code:
major_delay <- flights %>%
  filter(dep_delay > 60 | arr_delay > 60)
-->Great work!


Question 6, Score: 1
Student code:
carrier_table <- major_delay %>% 
  count(carrier)
-->Great work!


Question 7, Score: 1
Student code:
ggplot(carrier_table, aes(x="", y=n, fill = carrier)) +
  geom_col() + 
  coord_polar("y", start=0)
-->Great work!


Question 8, Score: 0
Student code:
JFK_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(origin=="EWR")
-->The contents of the variable `JFK_flights` aren't correct. It has 3527 rows and 19 columns, while it should have 3342 rows and 19 columns.


Question 9, Score: 1
Student code:
ggplot(JFK_flights, aes(x=dep_delay)) + 
  geom_histogram()
-->Great work!


Question 10, Score: 0
Student code:
dest_table<-JFK_flights %>% 
  count(dest) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
-->Check your call of `count()`. Did you correctly specify the argument `x`? It has 3527 rows and 19 columns, while it should have 3342 rows and 19 columns.


Question 11, Score: 1
Student code:
ggplot(dest_table, aes(x=reorder(dest, -n), y=n)) + 
  geom_col()
-->Great work!


Question 12, Score: 1
Student code:
flights %>%
  group_by(origin, carrier) %>%
  summarize(n=n())
-->Great work!


Question 13, Score: 0
Student code:
count_flight <- flights %>% 
  count(origin, carrier)
-->Did you define the variable `count_flights` without errors?


Question 14, Score: 1
Student code:
ggplot(count_flights, aes(x=carrier, y=n, color=carrier)) + 
  geom_point() 
-->Great work!


Question 15, Score: 1
Student code:
ggplot(count_flights, aes(x=carrier, y=n, color=carrier)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Carrier for each origin airport", y="Frequency") +
